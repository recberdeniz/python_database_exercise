# This part is also written to exercise about database application for Python Programming
# This part is the main code part of the Library database application
# First part is written as a module of Library.db
# Before using these two code parts, check folder directory and mark directory as source roots to use first part as
# a source module
# To mark directory as source roots; right click to the file directory where the two code parts
# and then choose mark directory as source roots in PyCharm compiler
